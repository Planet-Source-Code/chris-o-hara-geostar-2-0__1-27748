Introduction
---------------
Geostar is a powerful tool to create visually pleasing stars, that can be used as logo's
 or wallpapers, etc. It was created in 2001 by Chris O'Hara (Hybrid).

Usages
---------
After entering the application choose from the toolbar or option buttons, on the 
right hand side of the screen, what star you would like to create (GeoStar or 
GridStar). Enter the required feilds underneath the option buttons and select a 
background color and foreground color. Click create from the toolbar or in the 
bottom right hand side of the window, to create your star. Wait while the star 
is created. If you like the outcome, save it as a bitmap by selecting the 'save' 
button from the toolbar.

Over-ride
-----------
Over-ride was a feature added to put a limit on the star properties text fields to 
prevent high numbers being used to protect the computer from freezing. To unlock
or re-lock this feature, press the '!' (Over-ride) button on the toolbar.

Extra Features
-----------------
Typing in 'r' in any of the foreground fields tells the app that the color 
shouldl be random. To create spectacular effects type 'r' into all
foreground fields. Each line then becomes a random color between 1 and 16 million

Options
---------
Line width = The line width of the picturebox
Shadow = Toggles the presense of a shadow

COPYRIGHT
--------------
Modifying or copying the code at all, without the authors permission is not allowed, 
although feel free to use the stars as graphics in commercial or non-commercial use
